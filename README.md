# Project-1---RPG-game-design
This RPG game is programmed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
For now, there is no back-end to the game, and I am doing this game as part of a front-end boot camp.
Once launched, the game is simple to understand, but it consists in battling monsters.
You gain gold and experience points as you battle and defeat monsters.
You can then buy weapons and health with the gold that you earn from defeating monsters.
I am hoping to develop my web front-end design and programming skills with this project :-).
Enjoy!
