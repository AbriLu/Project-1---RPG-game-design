# Project-1---RPG-game-design
This game is an RPG game progammed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
For now there is no back-end to the game and I am doing this game as part of a front end bootcamp.
The game is simple to understand once lunched but simply put it consists in battling with monsters.
You gain gold and experience point as you battle and defeat monsters.
I am hoping to develop my web front-end design with this project :-).
Enjoy!
